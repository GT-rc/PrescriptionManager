This repository contains the files for my Capstone Project for LC101 Fall 2016. It is a work in progress, and I have temporarily set it 
aside while focusing on being a TF for the new LC101 cohort. When we get back to C# in a few more weeks, I'll get back to work on this 
project, but in the meantime, it is on hold. 
Previously it was working, but since I have moved it onto my new computer it is giving me a ton of dependency errors. I'm hoping that 
the rebuild of my computer this weekend will once again allow me to run the program, as well as make normal commits of my work. I've 
been using crazy workarounds because it won't let me initiate a repo from the command line -- this is neither here nor there. I will 
update this as soon as I get back to work on it. Thanks.
